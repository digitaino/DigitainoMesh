# `-only-testing` selector also silently runs 0 tests for Swift Testing suites, so the target
# below pins iOS 18.x and uses suite-level (type-level) filters. These same suites gate on
# `StoreKitTestAvailability.servesProducts`, so they auto-skip on iOS 26.x in the default
# run; `test-store` is how you actually exercise them. Override STORE_SIM if your machine
# has a different iOS 18.x simulator.

# process is gone (killed run) the stale lock is reclaimed after `ps -p` confirms it is dead,
# and it is released on exit. Skipped under $CI; runners are single-tenant. macOS `shlock` is

# wedge every later run. The calling recipe sets `dest` first.
