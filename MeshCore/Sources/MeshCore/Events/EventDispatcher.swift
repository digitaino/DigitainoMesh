/// Dispatches MeshEvents to subscribers via AsyncStream.

/// `EventDispatcher` is an actor that manages event subscriptions and dispatches
/// events to all active subscribers. It supports both unfiltered and filtered subscriptions.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let dispatcher = EventDispatcher()
///
/// // Subscribe to all events
/// let allEvents = await dispatcher.subscribe()
///
/// // Subscribe with a filter
/// let ackEvents = await dispatcher.subscribe { event in
///     if case .acknowledgement = event { return true }
///     return false
/// }
/// ```

    ///
    /// Uses bounded buffering to prevent memory issues with high-throughput events.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An async stream of all mesh events.
    ///
    /// - Important: Uses `.bufferingNewest(100)` which means if a subscriber processes
    ///   events slower than they arrive, older events may be dropped. For critical event
    ///   processing (e.g., debugging with `parseFailure` events), ensure your handler is
    ///   fast or process events asynchronously.
