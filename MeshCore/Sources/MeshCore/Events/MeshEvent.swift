/// Represents events emitted by a MeshCore device during communication.
///
/// `MeshEvent` encapsulates all possible events that can be received from a MeshCore
/// mesh networking device. These events are delivered through the ``MeshCoreSession/events()``
/// asynchronous stream.
///
/// ## Event Categories
///
/// Events fall into several categories:
///
/// - **Connection**: Session lifecycle and connection state changes
/// - **Command Responses**: Success/error responses to commands
/// - **Contacts**: Contact list updates and discovery
/// - **Messages**: Incoming messages and send confirmations
/// - **Network**: Advertisements, path updates, and routing events
/// - **Telemetry**: Sensor data and device statistics
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// for await event in await session.events() {
///     switch event {
///     case .contactMessageReceived(let message):
///         handleMessage(message)
///     case .advertisement(let publicKey):
///         print("Saw node: \(publicKey.hexString)")
///     case .connectionStateChanged(let state):
///         updateUI(for: state)
///     default:
///         break
///     }
/// }
/// ```
