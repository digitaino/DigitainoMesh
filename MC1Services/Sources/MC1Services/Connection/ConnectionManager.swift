/// Manages the connection lifecycle for mesh devices.
///
/// `ConnectionManager` owns the transport, session, and services. It handles:
/// - Device pairing via the `DevicePairingService` seam (AccessorySetupKit on iOS, in-app scan picker on macOS)
/// - Connection and disconnection
/// - Auto-reconnect on connection loss
/// - Last-device persistence for app restoration
///
/// ## Connection-state model
///
/// Three distinct enums describe "where are we", at three layers, and they do
/// not collapse into one another:
///
/// - `BLEPhase` (on `BLEStateMachine`): the CoreBluetooth link lifecycle
///   (`idle`, `connecting`, `discoveringServices`, `discoveryComplete`,
///   `connected`, `autoReconnecting`, ...). Driven by CBCentralManager
///   callbacks; every transition routes through `BLEStateMachine.transition(to:)`.
///   Concerns only the BLE transport, and is undefined for WiFi-bridged radios.
/// - `MeshCore.ConnectionState`: the transport-link state the session publishes
///   (`disconnected`, `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, `failed`).
///   `@_exported import MeshCore` makes its bare name visible app-wide; this one
///   is the lower layer.
/// - `DeviceConnectionState`: the app-facing rung (`disconnected`, `connecting`,
///   `connected`, `syncing`, `ready`). Adds the post-link `syncing`/`ready`
///   distinction the transport layer has no concept of. This is the value
///   `connectionState` holds and the one UI gates on.
///
/// `ConnectionManager` drives `connectionState` directly from the connect, sync,
/// disconnect, and reconnect paths; nothing else writes it. The transport layer
/// reports link events through the lifecycle callbacks wired in `init`
/// (`setDisconnectionHandler`, `setReconnectionHandler`, the auto-reconnect and
/// powered-on handlers), which this class translates into `connectionState`
/// transitions. `ConnectionIntent` is the orthogonal "does the user want to be
/// connected" axis that gates auto-reconnect, and is the only piece persisted
/// across launches. In DEBUG, `assertStateInvariants()` enforces that `.syncing`
/// and `.ready` always carry a live `services`, `session`, and `connectedDevice`,
/// and that `.userDisconnected` intent only coexists with `.disconnected`.
