// MARK: - Message Service Actor

/// Actor-isolated service for sending messages with retry logic and ACK tracking.
///
/// `MessageService` manages all message operations including:
/// - Sending direct messages to contacts with single-attempt or automatic retry
/// - Sending channel broadcast messages
/// - Tracking pending message acknowledgements (ACKs)
/// - Handling delivery confirmations and failures
/// - Automatic retry with flood routing fallback
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Send a message with automatic retry
/// let message = try await messageService.sendMessageWithRetry(
///     text: "Hello!",
///     to: contact
/// ) { messageDTO in
///     // Message saved, update UI immediately
///     await updateUI(with: messageDTO)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # ACK Tracking
///
/// After sending a message, the service tracks pending ACKs and automatically:
/// - Marks messages as delivered when ACK is received
/// - Marks messages as failed when timeout expires
/// - Tracks repeat acknowledgements for network analysis
///
/// Call `startEventMonitoring()` to begin processing ACKs from the session.
