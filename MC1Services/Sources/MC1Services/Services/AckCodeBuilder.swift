///
/// - **Recipient is not in the hash.** Same sender + same text + same UInt32
///   timestamp + same `attempt & 0x03` produces an identical ACK code across
///   *every* contact. Currently unreachable through the UI because each
///   `ChatConversationView` owns its own serialized `sendQueue`, so two sends
///   cannot finish in the same wall-clock second from the same conversation,
///   and parallel conversations cannot share text + timestamp. Any future
///   feature that dispatches identical-text sends in parallel (bulk send,
///   broadcast-to-many, scripted sends) must either serialize with ≥1s
///   spacing or replace `pendingAcks`'s ackCode lookup with a
///   `[Data: Set<UUID>]` index in `MessageService.handleAcknowledgement`.
/// - **Attempt index is masked to two bits.** Firmware applies `& 0x03`, so
///   only four distinct ACK codes exist for a given (text, timestamp, sender)
///   tuple. Attempt 4 collides with attempt 0, attempt 5 with attempt 1, etc.
///   `expectedAck` rejects `attempt >= 4` outright; `MessageServiceConfig`
///   must keep `maxAttempts <= 4`.
