/// Acceptance suite for the persistent `PendingSend.attemptCount` surface.
/// Covers three cases:
/// 1. Fresh send: enqueue then drain bumps 0 → 1, `preserveTimestamp == false`.
/// 2. Process restart: a row left at `attemptCount = 1` on disk (prior process
///    bumped then died before deleting the row) rehydrates, drains, bumps to
///    `2`, and uses `preserveTimestamp == true` so the recipient's mesh dedup
///    catches a duplicate landing.
/// 3. Bump failure: `incrementPendingSendAttemptCount` is forced to throw, the
///    envelope parks on the transport-open trigger, the row survives, and no
///    wire send happens.
