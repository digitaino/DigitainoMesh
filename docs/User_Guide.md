# MeshCore One User Guide

MeshCore One is a messaging app designed for off-grid communication using MeshCore-compatible mesh networking radios.

## 1. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A **MeshCore-compatible BLE radio** (e.g., a companion radio or repeater).
- An iPhone running **iOS 18.0 or later**.

### Onboarding

1. **Welcome**: Launch the app and tap "Get Started".
2. **Permissions**: Grant permissions for **Notifications** and **Location**. Location is needed for sharing your position with other mesh users.
3. **Discovery**: The app will scan for nearby MeshCore devices using AccessorySetupKit. Select your device from the list.
4. **Pairing**: Follow the on-screen instructions to pair your device. Bluetooth permission is requested automatically by AccessorySetupKit during device discovery. You may be prompted to enter a device PIN (device-specific).
5. **Region**: Choose your region (detected from your location when available, or selected manually). This narrows the radio presets shown to ones that work in your area.
6. **Radio Preset**: Choose a starter radio preset to configure frequency, power, and bandwidth quickly.

## 2. Messaging

### Direct Messages

- Go to **Chats** tab.
- Tap to **square.and.pencil** menu button and select **New Chat**, or select an existing contact.
- Type your message and tap **Send**.
- **Delivery Status** (shown as text labels below outgoing messages):
  - **"Sending..."**: Message is pending or being transmitted to your radio.
  - **"Sent"**: Your radio has accepted the message and queued it for transmission.
  - **"Delivered"**: The recipient's radio has confirmed receipt of message.
  - **"Retrying..."**: The app is attempting to resend (first via direct routing, then falling back to flood routing once the direct attempts are exhausted), shown with a spinner indicator.
  - **"Failed"**: The message could not be delivered after multiple attempts (red bubble background with exclamation icon).

### @Mentions

Mention other contacts in group chats to get their attention:

1. Type **@** in the message input field while composing.
2. A dropdown will appear with matching contacts from your contacts list.
3. Select a contact to insert their name as a mention.
4. The mentioned contact will be notified of the message.
5. Mentions are highlighted in the message for easy identification.

**Tips**:
- Mentions work in all message types: direct messages, channels, and rooms.
- The dropdown shows contact names and node names.
- Filter suggestions by typing after **@**.

### Link Previews

MeshCore One automatically generates rich previews for URLs shared in messages:

1. Paste a URL into the message input (e.g., `https://example.com`).
2. The app will fetch metadata (title, description, image) when the message is sent.
3. Recipients see a preview card instead of just the raw URL.
4. Tap the preview card to open the link in Safari.
5. Toggle link previews on/off in **Settings** > **Chats**.

**Link Preview Settings** (Settings > Chats):
- **Link Previews**: Turn automatic preview generation on/off.
- **Show in Direct Messages**: Fetch and show previews in direct messages.
- **Show in Channels**: Fetch and show previews in channels.
- Preview cards are fetched on-demand when messages are loaded.

### Reactions

React to messages with emoji in direct chats and channels:

1. Long-press a message and pick a reaction, or use the emoji row when available.
2. Reactions appear as badges below the message bubble.
3. Tap a badge to see who reacted and the full reaction list.

### Message Details

Long-press a message to view more context without leaving the sheet:

1. Tap **Repeat Details** to expand repeat info inline.
2. Tap **View Path** to expand hop/path details inline.
3. Expanding a detail section automatically grows the sheet for readability.

### Muting Conversations

Mute notifications for individual conversations to reduce distractions:

1. In the **Chats** list, long-press the conversation you want to mute to open its context menu.
2. Tap **Mute**.
3. The conversation will show a **muted bell icon** to indicate it's muted.
4. You'll still receive messages, but no notifications will appear.
5. Long-press the conversation again and tap **Unmute** to re-enable notifications.

**Note**: Muted conversations still display unread message badges in the app, just not push notifications.

### Blocking Contacts

Block unwanted contacts to prevent receiving messages from them:

1. In the **Nodes** list, long-press the contact you want to block to open its context menu.
2. Tap **Block**.
3. The contact will be moved to **Blocked Contacts** section.
4. Blocked contacts cannot send you messages.
5. You can view and manage blocked contacts from the **Nodes** tab.
6. Long-press a blocked contact and tap **Unblock** to allow messages again.

**Note**: The Block option appears only for chat-type contacts; repeaters and room servers cannot be blocked (the option is hidden for these contact types).

### Retrying Failed Messages

If a message fails to deliver:

1. Tap the **Retry** button that appears below the failed message.
2. The app re-attempts direct routing first, then falls back to flood routing (broadcast to all nearby nodes) only after the direct attempts are exhausted (by default, 4 direct attempts followed by 1 flood attempt).
3. You'll see retry progress: "Retrying 1/4...", "Retrying 2/4...", etc.

### Group Channels

- MeshCore One supports up to the device's channel limit (commonly 8 slots).
- **Slot 0 (Public)**: A default public channel for open communication.
- **Private Channels**: Configure a channel with a name and a passphrase to create a private group. Others must use the same name and passphrase to join.

## 7. Network Diagnostics Tools

MeshCore One includes powerful diagnostic tools for optimizing your mesh network performance and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

### Line of Sight Analysis

The Line of Sight (LoS) tool analyzes radio propagation between two points to help you determine if a reliable link is possible.

#### Accessing Line of Sight

1. Go to **Tools** tab.
2. Tap **Line of Sight**.
3. Choose the two points to analyze (your location, a contact, or a repeater).

#### Understanding the Analysis

The tool provides:

- **Terrain Profile**: Visual representation of terrain elevation between you and target
- **Fresnel Zone**: Visualization of the RF signal's optimal path (shown as curved lines)
- **Clearance Status**: Color-coded indicators:
  - **Green**: Clear line of sight, good signal expected
  - **Yellow**: Partial obstruction, signal may be degraded
  - **Red**: Obstructed path, poor signal or no connection likely
- **RF Parameters**: Calculated signal metrics:
  - **Path Loss**: Total path loss (free-space plus diffraction breakdown, in dB)
  - **Distance**: Distance between the two points
  - **First Fresnel Zone**: Worst Fresnel zone clearance percentage
  - **Obstructions**: Number of obstruction points along the path

#### Tips for Better Results

- Elevation data is fetched from Open-Meteo API (may require internet for first use)
- Move to higher ground if analysis shows obstruction
- Consider using repeaters to bypass obstacles
- Analysis assumes ideal conditions - real-world performance may vary

### Trace Path

Discover optimal routing paths through your mesh network with the Trace Path tool.

#### Using Trace Path

1. Go to **Tools** tab.
2. Tap **Trace Path**.
3. The app will discover available routes through repeaters to your target.

### Weather

The Weather tool shows severe weather alerts, current conditions and the forecast for one place, from a MeshWX weather bot on the mesh. A bot is a chat node named `WX-<city>` (WX-AUS in Austin) that puts National Weather Service products on the `#meshwx` channel as compact binary messages; the app decodes them with tables it carries, so the tool works with no internet at all.

**Requirements**

- MeshCore companion firmware 1.15 or newer on the radio. Older firmware never delivers these packets; the tool tells you when that is the case.
- The `#meshwx` channel on the radio. Once your radio's channel list has loaded, the tool offers to add it; nothing is written until you tap **Add channel**, and only into a slot the radio confirms is empty.
- A bot in range. Bots advertise like any node. With more than one, **About weather on the mesh** (the ⓘ in the header) lists them and offers **Choose automatically**.

**The place**

Everything on the screen answers for one place, named in the header. It is your location when the app has one; tap **Search a town**, or the place name, to pick a town or an airport code instead, for this visit, and **Back to my location** to return. Picking a place asks the bot for its forecast when the phone has none fresh for it. With no location the screen asks **Where do you want weather for?** and offers **Use my location** and **Search a town**. A location more than an hour old is shown as last known, with its age, and never earns the green check.

**What the screen shows**

1. **Alerts for <place>**: warnings, watches and advisories that cover the place or lie within 50 km, most dangerous first, each with its colour, a countdown, and for a nearby one its distance and direction. Tornado, extreme wind, flash flood and severe thunderstorm warnings are always listed; lesser alerts beyond two fold into "more". One line under the rows says what the app can vouch for:
   - a green check, **No alerts received**, only when a fresh alert list arrived while your radio was connected, no messages were missed, the place is inside the area the bot reports on, and nothing is active anywhere in that area;
   - otherwise the reason it can't tell (no alert list yet, the list is old, messages were missed, your radio isn't connected, the place is outside the bot's area), with **Ask for alerts** where asking would help.

   Tap an alert for its map (the storm polygon, or the zones and counties filled from bundled boundaries), whether it covers your place, its details and areas, and **Ask for full text** for the forecaster's narrative. **Alerts in WX-AUS's area** puts every alert the bot holds on one map and list.
2. **Now**: the nearest fresh weather station's reading, with its distance and the time of the report. When the phone holds no reading near the place, the card names the nearest weather station and offers **Ask for current conditions**. **Weather stations** lists every station the bot reports on; a station's page has all its readings and its coded airport reports, with **Ask for METAR (conditions)** and **Ask for TAF (forecast)**.
3. **Forecast**: the forecast for the place's nearest forecast point, labelled Today, Tonight, Tomorrow and by weekday, with **Ask for forecast** when nothing is held for it. A place more than 115 km from any forecast point says so rather than borrowing a distant one.
4. **Weather Service text reports**: the forecast discussion, hazardous weather outlook, storm reports and rainfall totals for your state (which you can change), and space weather, each with **Ask for latest**. Long replies arrive in parts; a part that never arrives is marked.

**How asking works**

Asking is public: a request is a direct message to the bot, and the answer comes back on `#meshwx` for every phone listening. The tool says so under the first ask button, labels answers somebody else asked for as theirs, and doesn't ask for anything the channel delivered in the last five minutes. It never asks on its own: one request per tap, five seconds apart, and one retry only if the bot has gone silent, after which it says the bot may be out of range. The bot's own broadcasts (warnings as they change, the alert list every three hours, station readings every hour) are kept whether or not the tool is open, and the last picture is shown with its age even with no radio connected. **Clear received weather**, in About, removes everything received from a bot.

## 8. iPad Experience

MeshCore One provides an optimized experience on iPad with split-view navigation and enhanced layouts.

### Split-View Navigation

On iPad, the app uses a split-view layout:

- **Left Panel**: List view (chats, nodes, tools, etc.)
- **Right Panel**: Detail view (conversation, contact details, map, etc.)
- **Independent Navigation**: Each panel has its own navigation stack
- **Responsive**: Automatically adjusts when rotating device or resizing window

#### Navigation Behavior

- Tapping an item in left panel opens it in right panel
- Right panel navigation doesn't affect left panel state
- Close right panel by tapping back button or swiping
- Both panels update independently when data changes

#### Tab Navigation

- Chats, Nodes, Tools, and Settings use split-view
- Map uses a single-pane layout with a full-screen map
- Chat conversation opens in right panel while chat list remains visible

### iPad-Specific Features

- **Enhanced Map**: Larger map view with more visible markers
- **Side-by-Side Chat**: View conversation list and chat simultaneously
- **Expanded Settings**: More space for configuration options
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Orientation Support

- **Portrait / narrow widths**: The split view collapses to a single column (showing the list, with the sidebar overlaid or pushed in)
- **Landscape**: Side-by-side panels (list on left, detail on right)
- **Resize**: Drag divider to adjust panel sizes (when supported by iOS)

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure your radio is powered on and within Bluetooth range of your iPhone.
- If the app loses connection, it will attempt to reconnect automatically.
- If you cannot pair, try "forgetting" the device in the app and in the iOS Bluetooth settings.

### Message Delivery Failures

- Mesh networking depends on line-of-sight and signal strength.
- If a message fails, try moving to a higher location or closer to a repeater.
- You can tap the **Retry** button on a failed message to resend using flood mode.

### Sync Issues

- If contacts or channels seem out of date, pull down on the list to refresh.
- The app shows a "Syncing..." indicator when synchronizing with your radio.

### Battery Drain

- Reduce transmit power if you don't need maximum range.
- Disable location sharing if you don't need others to see your position.
- The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy, which is designed for efficiency.
